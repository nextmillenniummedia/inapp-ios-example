# Test Your Integration

You're encouraged to test your SDK integration prior to publishing your app to the respective app store.

- Follow the integration instructions for an ad format that you'd like to use in your app;
- Get the required ad unit IDs (for example `555`) from your account manager (contact `support@nextmillennium.io`) if you require assistance);
- To display test ads you're required to use Simulator. Test ads won't be displayed on a physical device;

Expected result is an ad unit displaed with a test label. For example:
